# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Alexandru Soroiu**

**Wordle** is an app that generates random words and the user has to guess them! The letters that are in the right position are green marked, and the letters that are contained in the word, but not in the right position, are marked with yellow!

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [x] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- [ ] Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Some challenges that I encounter mostly were about Swift syntax as I have not worked with it before, but I was able to look up the documentation and it really came in handy!
